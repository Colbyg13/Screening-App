NOTES FOR SAMOA APP

Upgrades wanted:
- use multiple computers (cross computer db sharing).
- Add signatures to records.
- Have selected values for custom types (that can be converted).
- Need ability to delete old templates (maybe store these in file system)

Problems:
- Adding a record -  Dismissing the modal then saving will create a new record.
- Ipad will continue to stack lots of fields for offline mode.
- No support for different screen sizes.
- Deleting all records needs to delete all fields.
